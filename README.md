# 🚦 Real-Time Traffic Object Detection in Dhaka, Bangladesh 🚗  

## 🌟 Project Overview  
The project focuses on analyzing **traffic video feed data** from Dhaka, Bangladesh. 🌍 The goal is to process each frame of the video to **detect and label objects** such as cars, people, and other traffic elements in **real-time**. 🎥 You'll use a **pre-trained model** and extend it to detect **custom objects** tailored to the task of analyzing traffic feed data. 🚸  

**Key Components**:

1. **Data Handling**: 
   - Work with XML data containing bounding box information.
   - Extract individual frames from video files for further analysis.

2. **Object Detection Models**:
   - Utilize the pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model for initial object detection tasks.
   - Extend the YOLO model to recognize custom objects, adapting it for traffic feed data analysis.

3. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Enhance the model's ability to generalize by augmenting the data during training, improving detection accuracy and robustness.

**Skills and Knowledge Gained**:

- 📦 **How to work with XML files containing bounding box data**  
- 🖼️ **How to extract frames from video files**  
- 🤖 **How to apply the pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model**  
- 🛠️ **How to train YOLO to detect custom objects specific to traffic analysis**  
- 🎯 **How to use data augmentation techniques to improve the model's ability to generalize during training**

This project is an exciting opportunity to dive into **real-time object detection** and apply cutting-edge computer vision techniques to solve real-world traffic monitoring challenges! 🌐🚶‍♂️
